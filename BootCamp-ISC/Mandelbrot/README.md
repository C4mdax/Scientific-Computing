# Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers $c$ for which the sequence defined by the iteration $z_{n+1} = z^2_n + c$, with $z_0 = 0$, 
remains bounded in absolute value as nn tends to infinity. Mathematically, the Mandelbrot set is defined as:
$M =$ { $c \in \mathbb{C}:|z_{n+1}|\leq R, \forall n \geq 0$ } 
where $R$ is a positive real number. To visualize the Mandelbrot set, each point in the complex plane is assigned a color, corresponding to how many iterations it took for the sequence to pass a certain limit. Points inside the set are usually colored black, 
while points outside the set are colored based on how many iterations it took to get out. The Mandelbrot set exhibits a unique fractal structure. The Mandelbrot fractal is the graphical representation of the Mandelbrot set. It is generated by calculating whether or not each point cc in the complex plane belongs to the Mandelbrot set, 
and then assigning a color to each point based on the number of iterations required to determine its membership in the set.
